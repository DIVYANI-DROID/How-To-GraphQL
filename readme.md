# How-To-GraphQL
GraphQL is a new API standard that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST. It was developed and open-sourced by Facebook 
and is now maintained by a large community of companies and individuals from all over the world.  APIs have become ubiquitous components of software 
infrastructures. In short, an API defines how a client can load data from a server.  At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can 
specify exactly what data it needs from an API. Instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint 
and responds with precisely the data a client asked for.
